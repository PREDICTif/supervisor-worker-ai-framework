## 📋 Minimal File Set

For a quick start, you only need these 4 files:

```
docs/SUPERVISOR/
├── SUPERVISOR-FRAMEWORK.md   # How to supervise
├── WORKER-FRAMEWORK.md       # How to work
├── CURRENT-STATUS.md         # Where we are

The other files (THINKING-LOG, DECISIONS-LOG) can be added as needed.
